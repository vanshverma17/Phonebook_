# Phonebook_
I made a phonebook using C language. I used the concept of array of linkedlist. Each element of the array is a linkedlist itself representing the alphabets from A to Z. Structure of the linkedlist contains name, number and address. Contacts are saved in the respected array by identifying the initial letter of the name.
The basic function that this program can perform is insertion of the contacts, deletion of the contacts, search function to search an existing contact in the phonebook, display of the whole phonebook, clear the whole phonebook(removing every data/contact it contains), count contacts counts the number of contacts the phonebook have and modify and existing contact.
This program is menu driven with the help of switch statements. Hope this program will be helpful.
